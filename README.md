# TIP 103 Problem Sets

This repo contains all TIP 103 problem sets. I will be adding them weekly as the course proceeds.

Go to the [problems](./problems) directory to find all the problems without solutions. 

To work on a problem set, copy and paste the `weekX` directory from [problems](./problems) to the root directory to exclude it from version control.
