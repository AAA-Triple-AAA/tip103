# TIP 103 Problem Sets

A curated collection of problem sets for TIP 103, organized by week and session. Problems are regularly updated as the course progresses.

## 📁 Structure

- **[problems/](./problems)** - All problem sets with problem statements
  - `week1/`, `week2/`, ... - Problem sets organized by week
  - Each week contains multiple sessions with problem sets
- **[starter1/](./starter1)** - Boilerplate week folders and python files
- **week\*/** - Your working copies (git-ignored to keep your progress private)

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. View problems in the [problems](./problems) directory
2. Copy a `week*` folder from [problems](./problems) to the root directory to work on it
3. Solve the problems in your local copy
4. Your changes in the root-level `week*` folders won't be tracked by git

## 📝 Organization

Problem sets are organized as follows:
- Each week contains two sessions
- Each session contains two problem sets
- Each problem set has around 6-8 individual problems
