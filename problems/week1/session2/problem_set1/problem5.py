Problem 5: Container with Most Honey

Christopher Robin is helping Pooh construct the 
biggest hunny jar possible.

Help him write a function that accepts an integer array 
heights of length n. The height of each element is given 
by heights[i].

There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints 
of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, heights[i]).

Find two lines that, together with the x-axis, form the 
container that holds the most honey.

Return the maximum amount of honey a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

Example Usage:
height = [1, 8, 6, 2, 5, 4, 8, 3, 7]
most_honey(height)

height = [1, 1]
most_honey(height)

Example Output:
49
