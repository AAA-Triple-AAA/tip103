Problem 5: Heist

The legendary outlaw Robin Hood is looking for the target of his next 
heist. Write a function wealthiest_customer() that accepts an m x n 2D 
integer matrix accounts where accounts[i][j] is the amount of money the 
ith customer has in the jth bank. Return a list [i, w] where i is the 
0-based index of the wealthiest customer and w is the total wealth of 
the wealthiest customer.

If multiple customers have the highest wealth, return the index of any customer.

A customer's wealth is the amount of money they have in all their bank accounts. 
The richest customer is the customer that has the maximum wealth.

Example Usage:
accounts = [
	[1, 2, 3],
	[3, 2, 1]
]
wealthiest_customer(accounts)

accounts = [
	[1, 5],
	[7, 3],
	[3, 5]
]
wealthiest_customer(accounts)

accounts = [
	[2, 8, 7],
	[7, 1, 3],
	[1, 9, 5]
]
wealthiest_customer(accounts)

Example Output:
[0, 6]
[1, 10]
[0, 17]
